## System Architecture & Modules

### 1. User Management
- **Features:** Registration, role assignment, profile management, facial recognition, bulk operations, password reset.
- **User Roles:** Administrator, HOD, Trainer, Trainee.
- **Highlights:** Secure email verification, unique email enforcement, facial image upload for attendance, bulk user import.
- **Integration Points:** User data is linked to attendance, scheduling, notifications, and reporting modules. Role-based access controls all system features.

### 2. School Management
- **Features:** School, department, programme, class group, academic year/term management.
- **Highlights:** Unique school instance, department/HOD assignment, unique class group names, non-overlapping academic terms.
- **Integration Points:** School structure underpins course mapping, timetable generation, and reporting granularity.

### 3. Course Management
- **Features:** Course creation, topic/subtopic definition, mapping to programmes, enrollment, analytics, bulk registration.
- **Highlights:** Prerequisite enforcement, session structure, Excel import, analytics dashboard.
- **Integration Points:** Courses are mapped to programmes and class groups, feeding into timetable and attendance modules.

### 4. Timetable Management
- **Features:** Room management, trainer availability, session scheduling, conflict detection, draft/publish workflows.
- **Highlights:** Real-time conflict checks, geolocation for attendance, session types (lecture, lab, etc.), notifications for changes.
- **Integration Points:** Timetables are generated based on course mappings, trainer/class group availability, and room resources. Changes trigger notifications and update attendance expectations.

### 5. Attendance Management
- **Features:** Session lifecycle, attendance marking, validation (facial, geolocation), analytics, troubleshooting.
- **Highlights:** Automated validation, session status tracking, analytics by course/group/trainer.
- **Integration Points:** Attendance is linked to timetable sessions, user profiles (facial data), and reporting/analytics modules.
- **Example:** A trainee marks attendance using facial recognition and geolocation at the scheduled session time; the system validates and logs the record.

### 6. Notifications
- **Features:** In-app, email, push notifications, user preferences, broadcast, delivery tracking.
- **Highlights:** Customizable preferences, mandatory system alerts, Do Not Disturb, delivery troubleshooting.
- **Integration Points:** Notifications are triggered by events in attendance, timetable, reporting, and user management modules.
- **Example:** A trainer receives a push notification when a timetable session is rescheduled.

### 7. Reports & Analytics
- **Features:** Attendance, performance, operational, and custom reports; export (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON); scheduling; notifications.
- **Highlights:** Real-time and scheduled reports, advanced filtering, export for stakeholders.
- **Integration Points:** Reports aggregate data from all modules, supporting compliance, performance tracking, and decision-making.
- **Example:** An admin schedules a weekly attendance report for all departments, delivered via email and in-app notification.

## Cross-Module Workflows & Examples
- **Enrollment to Attendance:** Admin enrolls a class group in a course → Timetable is generated → Trainees and trainers receive notifications → Attendance is marked and validated during sessions.
- **Bulk Operations:** Admins can import users or courses in bulk, with system validation and feedback for errors.
- **Role-Based Access:** HODs can manage only their department’s structure and trainers; trainers see only their assigned courses and schedules.
- **Automated Alerts:** System notifies users of schedule changes, low attendance, or new reports based on their preferences.

---

## Security & Data Integrity
- **Authentication:** Email/password, email verification, password reset.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control for all modules, with audit trails for sensitive actions.
- **Data Validation:** Unique constraints, prerequisite checks, conflict detection, facial/geolocation validation.
- **Audit & Logs:** System logs for key actions, error tracking, and troubleshooting support. Logs are accessible to admins for compliance.
- **Privacy:** Facial images and sensitive data are stored securely and used only for attendance/security purposes.
