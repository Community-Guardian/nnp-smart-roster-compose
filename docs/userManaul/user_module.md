# User Management Module - User Manual

## Overview
The User Management module allows administrators and users to manage user accounts, roles, and profiles. It supports registration, profile completion, facial image upload, and bulk user operations.

## User Roles
- **Trainee:** Student enrolled in a programme/class group.
- **Trainer:** Instructor assigned to courses and class groups.
- **HOD:** Head of Department, manages department structure and trainers.
- **Administrator:** Full system access for user and system management.

## Key User Workflows

### For Administrators
- **Register a New User:**
  1. Go to the Users section.
  2. Click 'Add User'.
  3. Enter user details (email, name, role, etc.).
  4. Assign to department, class group, or programme as needed.
     - *Tip: Assigning users to the correct department/class group ensures accurate scheduling and reporting.*
  5. Save to create the user; an email verification is sent.
- **Bulk User Registration:**
  1. Download the Excel template from the Users section.
  2. Fill in user details for multiple users.
     - *Tip: Follow the template instructions for required columns and formats. Each row is a user.*
  3. Upload the completed file to register users in bulk.
  4. Users receive email invitations to complete registration.
- **Assign Roles & Profiles:**
  1. Edit a user to assign or change their role (trainee, trainer, HOD, etc.).
     - *Tip: Only one primary role per user is allowed, but users can have multiple assignments (e.g., trainer in multiple departments).* 
  2. Complete or update profile details as needed.
- **Manage Facial Recognition:**
  1. For each user, upload a clear facial image.
     - *Tip: Use a recent, well-lit photo with only one face visible. This is required for attendance and security.*
  2. The system processes and stores the face encoding for attendance and security.

### For Users (Trainees, Trainers, HODs, etc.)
- **Complete Profile:**
  1. Log in with your email and password.
  2. Complete your profile details (personal info, academic/professional info).
  3. Upload a clear facial image for attendance verification.
     - *Tip: You cannot mark attendance without a valid facial image on file.*
- **Update Profile:**
  - Edit your profile at any time to update contact info, qualifications, or facial image.
- **Password Reset:**
  - Use the 'Forgot Password' link to reset your password via email.
  - *Tip: Check your spam folder if you do not receive the reset email.*
