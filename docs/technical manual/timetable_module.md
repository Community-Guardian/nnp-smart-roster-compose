# Timetable Management Module - Technical Manual

## Overview
The Timetable Management module is responsible for scheduling, managing, and validating all class sessions, room bookings, and trainer availabilities. It ensures conflict-free, optimized timetables for all class groups, trainers, and rooms.

## Architecture
- **Models:**
  - `Room`: Defines physical/virtual teaching spaces, with capacity, facilities, geolocation, maintenance, and availability.
  - `TrainerAvailability`: Tracks when trainers are available for scheduling, with term-specific options and conflict checks.
  - `Timetable`: Represents scheduled sessions, linking enrollments to days, times, rooms, and session types. Handles recurring, draft, and makeup sessions.
  - `ClassGroupSchedule`: Cached weekly schedule for each class group and term, for fast access.
- **Views:**
  - REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on rooms, availabilities, timetables, and schedules.
  - Endpoints for conflict checking, alternative suggestions, and analytics.
- **Serializers:**
  - Serializers for each model, supporting detail, list, and update operations.

## Key Features & Constraints
- **Room Management:**
  - Rooms have types, capacity, facilities, geolocation zones, maintenance schedules, and booking limits.
  - Geolocation validation for attendance and scheduling.
- **Trainer Availability:**
  - Trainers define available slots, with validation for overlaps and term specificity.
- **Timetable Scheduling:**
  - Timetable entries link enrollments to days, times, rooms, and session types (theory/practical).
  - Supports recurring, draft, and temporary (makeup) sessions.
  - Conflict detection for trainers, class groups, and rooms, with alternative suggestions.
- **Validation & Constraints:**
  - Strict validation for overlapping sessions, room bookings, and trainer/class group assignments.
  - Maintenance and geolocation constraints enforced for room usage.
- **Performance:**
  - Query optimizations, indexed fields, and schedule caching for fast access.
- **Security:**
  - Role-based access enforced at API and query level.
  - All sensitive operations require authentication.

## Integration Points
- **Course Management:** Uses enrollments for session scheduling.
- **School Management:** Links to departments, class groups, and terms.
- **Attendance Module:** Provides session data for attendance tracking.
- **User Management:** Assigns trainers to sessions and availabilities.

## Data Flow
1. **Room & Availability Setup:** Admins define rooms and trainer availabilities.
2. **Timetable Creation:** Sessions are scheduled, validated for conflicts, and published.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** System checks for conflicts and suggests alternatives.
4. **Schedule Access:** Class groups, trainers, and rooms access their schedules via API or UI.
5. **Integration:** Timetable data is used for attendance, reporting, and analytics.

## Error Handling & Logging
- All critical operations are validated before saving.
- Errors are logged with context for debugging.
- User-facing errors are descriptive and actionable.
