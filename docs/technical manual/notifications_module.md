# Notifications Module - Technical Manual

## Overview
The Notifications module manages all user and system notifications, including in-app, email, and push notifications. It supports individual, broadcast, and preference-based notifications for all user roles.

## Architecture
- **Models:**
  - `Notification`: Stores individual notifications for users, with type, priority, status, and related object references.
  - `NotificationPreference`: User preferences for notification types and delivery channels (email, push, in-app).
  - `BroadcastNotification`: Notifications sent to multiple users or groups (roles, departments, class groups, etc.).
- **Views:**
  - REST API endpoints for listing, marking as read/unread, and managing notification preferences.
  - Endpoints for sending and broadcasting notifications.
- **Serializers:**
  - Serializers for notification creation, update, and preference management.

## Key Features & Constraints
- **Notification Types:**
  - Attendance, report, account, session, and system notifications.
  - Priority levels: low, medium, high.
- **Delivery Channels:**
  - In-app, email, and push notifications, based on user preferences.
- **Broadcasting:**
  - Send notifications to all users, by role, department, school, or class group.
- **Status Tracking:**
  - Mark notifications as read/unread, deleted, with timestamps.
- **Integration:**
  - Linked to any object in the system via generic foreign keys.
- **Performance:**
  - Indexed fields for fast retrieval and filtering.
- **Security:**
  - Only authorized users can send or broadcast notifications.

## Integration Points
- **Attendance, Reports, Account, and Session modules:** Trigger notifications for key events (e.g., session start, report ready, account changes).
- **User Management:** Uses user roles and preferences for targeting and delivery.

## Data Flow
1. **Event Trigger:** System or user action triggers a notification.
2. **Notification Creation:** Notification is created and delivered via enabled channels.
3. **User Interaction:** User reads, marks as read/unread, or deletes notification.
4. **Preference Management:** Users set preferences for notification types and channels.

## Error Handling & Logging
- All critical operations are validated before saving.
- Errors are logged with context for debugging.
- User-facing errors are descriptive and actionable.
